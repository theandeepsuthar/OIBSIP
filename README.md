TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I worked on an interesting project to classify iris flowers. The #irisdataset consists of three different types

of species:

Setosa, Versicolor, Virginia. The goal was to develop a model that accurately predicts iris flower types based on measurements.

Project: Unemployment Analysis with Python
In this project, I focused on utilizing Python to analyze unemployment trends. I worked with two datasets to gain insights into employment and unemployment patterns in both rural and urban areas, as well as different regions.


Dataset 1:
By analyzing dataset 1, I found that rural areas had a higher number of estimated employed individuals compared to urban areas. Additionally, rural areas exhibited a higher estimated labor participation rate. On the other hand, urban areas experienced a higher estimated unemployment rate when compared to rural areas.
Dataset 2:


Dataset 2 allowed me to analyze employment and unemployment across different regions. The South region stood out with a high estimated unemployment rate, while the West region had a substantial number of estimated employed individuals. Furthermore, the Northeast region displayed a high estimated labor participation rate.
By leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities, I was able to draw meaningful conclusions from these datasets. This project has enhanced my skills in data analysis and Python programming, providing me with valuable insights into unemployment trends.
I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It has been a rewarding experience that has expanded my knowledge and proficiency in Python and data analysis.
