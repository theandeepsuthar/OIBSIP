TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I worked on an interesting project to classify iris flowers. The #irisdataset consists of three different types

of species:

Setosa, Versicolor, Virginia. The goal was to develop a model that accurately predicts iris flower types based on measurements.
